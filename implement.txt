definitions:
• block – a filled space on the board
• hole – an unfilled space that is located below a filled
space
• pit – an unfilled space that is not a hole and has a
filled space (or the board edge) on its left and right
• column height – the row where a column's highest
block is located


Let it run the move, then let it fall in test run, evaluate the impact then next move

1. only predict using one move
2. decide which piece to use of the current by rotating,
    choose where to let it fall and touch down,

3. try to implement not just inital 9 possible moves
    to fill gaps it might need to shift mid grid to fit in
    (all possible moves just became exponential, lmao, but yes still in limit)

4. try to remove redundant moves ig?

Try to change the falltime % 100 == x1
to prevent clashh or anything


The M features are as follows:
• WeightedBlocks – weighted sum of blocks, where a
block's weight is the row it's on
• Roughness – sum of absolute difference between
adjacent column heights
• ClearableLine – maximum number of lines
potentially clearable by a single I (straight) piece
• LinesCleared – number of lines currently cleared
during the game


• ConnectedHoles – number of vertically connected
holes
• Tetrises – number of tetrises currently made during
the game
• PitHolePercent – number of pits / (number of pits +
number of holes)
• DeepestWell – the row containing the lowest unfilled
block that is not a hole
• Blocks – number of blocks on the board
• ColHoles – number of columns containing at least one
hole
